timeout: 2

# Default termination character
term_char: CR+LF

# Query instrument errors (True or False).  If True, every command sent to the device will
# be followed by an error query.  This is useful when testing new setups, but may degrade
# performance by slowing down the instrument communication.

# 5: Command error
# 6: User request
# 7: Power on

#   set_cmd:       Command used to send data to the instrument. Put <*> where the value should appear.
#   get_cmd:       Command used to get the data from the instrument. Default is set_cmd?
